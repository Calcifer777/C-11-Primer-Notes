# Functions

## Basics

A function can not return an array type or a function type, but it can return a pointer to array or a pointer to a function.

**Local variables** Variables defined inside a block.

**Automatic object**: an object that exists only while a block is executing. Automatic objects corresponding to local
variables are initialized if their definition contains an initializer. Otherwise, they are default initialized, which means that uninitialized local variables of built-in type have undefined values.

**Local static object**: local objects whose value persists across calls to the function. Local static objects that are created and initialized before control reaches their use and are destroyed when the program ends.

**Function declaration (prototypes)**: `returnType functionName(typeP1 p1, typeP2 p2 ...);` . The header that declares a function should be included in the source file that defines that function.
