# Statements

## Simple and compound statements

**Simple statements**
* *Expression statement*: expression followed by a `;`. The expression is evaluated and the result discarded. 
* *Null statement*: useful where the language requires a statement but the programâ€™s logic does not.

**Compound Statements (blocks)**: a sequence of statements surrounded by a pair of curly braces Variables defined in the control structure are visible only within that statement. and are out of scope after the statement ends.

## Conditional statements

**`If`**

```c++
if (cond) {
	statement
} else if {
	statement 
} else {
	statement
}
```

*Dangling else*: Colloquial term used to refer to the problem of how to process nested if statements in which there are more ifs than elses. In C++, an else is
always paired with the closest preceding unmatched `if`. Note that curly braces can be used to effectively hide an inner if so that the programmer can control
which if a given else should match.

**`switch`**

```c++
switch (variable) {
	case intConstExpr1: 	// Case label: the value must be an integral constant expression
		statement1;
		break;
	...
	case intConstExprN:
		statement;
		break;
	default:
		statement;
		break;
	}
```

If a variable needs to be declared inside a switch statement AND for a particulare *case*, it is necessary define it inside a block.

## Iterative statements
