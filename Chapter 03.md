# Chapter 3. Strings, Vectors, and Arrays

To use the `string` type:
```c++
#include <string>
using std::string;
```

## 3.1 Namespace `using` Declarations

```c++
using namespace std;
```

```c++
using std::cout;
using std::cin;
```

A separate `using` declarations is required for each namespace member. 

## 3.2 Library `string` Type

### Types of `string` initialization

| Code					| Result					|
| --------------------- | ------------------------- |
| `string s1`			| Default initialization; `s1` is empty	|
| `string s2(s1)`		| `s2` is a copy of `s1`	|
| `string s1 = s2`	 	| `s2` is a copy of `s1`	|
| `string s3 = "value"`	| `s3` is a copy of the string literal		|
| `string s3("value")`	| `s3` is a copy of the string literal		|
| `string s4(n, 'c')`	| `s4` results in `c` repeated `n` times		|

The `string` default initialization value is the **empty string**.

Using `=` **copy initializes** the string. Using brackets uses **direct initialization**.

### Operations on `string` variables

| Code				| Result 					|
| ----------------- | ------------------------- |
| `os << s` 		| Writes `s` in the output 	|
| `is >> s`			| Reads the string `si` from the input as saves it as `s`. <br /> When reading strings from input lines, `cin` reads until the first whitespace;	|
| `getline(is, s)`	| Reads a line of input from `is` into `s`	|
| `s.empty()` 		| TRUE is `s` is empty		|
| `s.size()` 		| Returns the number of characters in `s`in a `string::size_type` value	|
| `s[n]` 			| Returns the `n`th *char* in `s`			|
| `s1+s2` 			| Concatenates `s1` and `s2` or  a `string` and a literal. <br /> When using `+` in an initialization of a string at least one of the two operands has to be a string.|
| `s1=s2` 			| Replaces the value in `s1` with that `s2` |
| `s1==s2` 			| TRUE if `s1` and `s2` hold the same values|
| `s1!=s2` 			| TRUE if `s1` and `s2` hold different values |
| `<, <=, >, >=` 	| Comparisons are case sensitive and use dictionary order	|

When reading strings from input lines, `cin` reads until the first whitespace;

### Characters in strings

The functions below are defined in the `cctype` header.

| Code 				| Result						|
| ----------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `isalphanum(c)`	| TRUE if `c` is a letter or digit						|
| `isalpha(c)`		| TRUE if `c` is a letter								|
| `iscntrl(c)`		| TRUE if `c` is a control character 					|
| `isdigit(c)`		| TRUE if `c` is a digit								|
| `isgraph(c)`		| TRUE if `c` is not a space but  is printable			|
| `islower(c)` 		| TRUE if `c` is lowercase								|
| `isupper(c)` 		| TRUE if `c` is uppercase								|
| `isprint(c)`		| TRUE if c is a printable character 					|
| `ispunct(c)` 		| TRUE if `c` is a punctuation character 				|
| `isspace(c)`		| TRUE if `c` is a whitespace (\s, \n, \t, \r, \f, \v)	|
| `isxdigit(c)` 	| TRUE if `c` a hexadecimal digit 						|
| `tolower(c)` 		| Returns the lowercase equivalent of a character		|
| `toupper(c)` 		| Returns the uppercase equivalent of a character		|

### `Rangefor` 

```c++
for (declaration : expression) {
	statement
}
```

Example

```c++
string s("Some random String");
for (auto $c : s) {				// c is a reference
	c = toupper(c);
}
```

### The subscript operator `[ ]`

Subscripts start at 0. The result of using an index outside this range is undefined; by implication, subscripting an empty string is undefined.

## 3.3 Library `vector` Template

```c++
#include <vector>
```

### Vector initialization

| Code 								| Result 									|
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| `vector<T>v1`						| **v1** of type T 							|
| `vector<T>v2(v1)`					| **v2** copy of *v1* 						|
| `vector<T>v2 = v1`				| **v2** copy of *v1*							|
| `vector<T>v3(n, val)`				| **v3** is made of *val* repeated *n* times	|
| `vector<T>v4(n)`					| **v4** holds *n* initialized objects			|
| `vector<T>v5{a, b, c, ...}`		| **v5** hlds *a*, *b*, *c*, ...				|
| `vector<T>v5 = {a, b, c, ...}`	| **v5** hlds *a*, *b*, *c*, ...				|

If the vector holds elements of a built-in type, then the element initializer has a value of 0. If it holds a class type, the element initializer is itself default initialized.

### Vector operations

| Code 				| Result 				|
| ----------------- 		| --------------------------------- 	|
| `v.empty()`			| TRUE if *v* is empty 			|
| `v.size()`			| Returns the size of v 		|
| `v.push_back(obj)`		| Appends to v 				|
| `v[n]`			| Returns the nth element of v 		|
| `v1 = v2`			| **v1** is now equal to *v2* 		|
| `v1 = {a, b, ...}`		| **v1** is now *{a,b, ...}*		|
| `v1 == v2`			| TRUE if **v1** and *v2* are equal 	|
| <, <=, >, >=			| Uses dictionary order			|
| `++v[n]`			| Increments the value of the nth index |

## 3.4 Introducind Iterators

| Code 				| Result 				|
| ----------------- 		| --------------------------------- 	|
| `*iter`			| Returns a reference to the element denoted by the iterator iter 			|
| `iter->mem`			| Dereferences `iter` and fetches the member named mem from the underlying element; equivalent to `{+iter}.menu` |
| `++iter`, `--iter`		| Increments/decrements `iter` to refer to the next/previous element in the container 				|
| `iter1 == iter2`		| Compares two iterators for equality, i.e. whether they denote the same element  or if they are the off-the-end iterator for the same container	|
| `iter1 != iter2`		| Compares two iterators for inequality 		|
| `iter.begin()`		| Denotes the first element in iter |
| `iter.end()`			| DEnotes one past the last last element in `iter`|; the iterator returned is referred to as the **off-the-end-operator** |

**Iterator Types**

| Code				| Result 			|
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `vector<int>::iterator it;` 	| Can r/w `vector<int>` elements	|
| `string::iterator it2`	| Can r/w characters in a string	|
| `vector<int>::const_iterator`	| Can r but not w elements		|
| `string::constr_iterator it4`	| Can read but not w elements		|

If the object is `const`, then `.begin` and `.end` return a `const_iterator`; if the object is not `const`, they return `iterator`.

As do the `begin` and `end` members, these members return iterators to the first and one past the last element in the container. However, regardless of whether the vector (or string) is `const`, they return a `const_iterator`.

`(*it).empty()` \\ dereferences the iterator `it` and calls the member *empty* on the resulting object.. This Command is equivalent to the `->` operator.

**Important** Loops that use iterators should not add elements to the container to which the iterators refer.

**Operations supported by `vector` and `string` operators**

| Code				| Result 			|
| ----------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| `iter + n`, `iter - n` 	| Returns an **operator** `n` elements forward/backward within the container |	|
| `iter += n`, `iter -= n`	| Assigns to `iter` the value of adding/subtracting `n` from/to `iter` |	|
| `iter1-iter2`	| Returns the number of places from `iter1` to `iter2`. The result type is a signed integral type named
`difference_type`	|
| `<`, `<=`, `>`, `>=`	| One operator is less than another if it appears in the container before the one referred to by the other iterator		|

## 3.5 Arrays

Like a vector, an array is a container of unnamed objects of a single type that we access by
position. **Unlike a vector, arrays have fixed size**.

If the array declarator has the form `a[d]`, where `a` is the name being defined and `d` is the dimension of the array. The
dimension specifies the number of elements and must be greater than zero. The number of elements in an array is part of the arrayâ€™s type. As a result, the dimension must be known at compile time, which means that the dimension must
be a constant expression (**`constexpr`**).

Arrays can also be list initialized, in which case we need not to declare the dimension.

As with variables of built-in type, a default-initialized array of built-in type that is defined inside a function will have undefined values.

**Character arrays** can be initialized from string literals.

``` c++
	int (*pointerToArray)[10] = &arr;
	// pointerToArray points to an array of 10 ints
	
	int *(&arrRef)[10] = arr;
	// arrRef is a reference to an int array (arr) of size 10
```

When using a variable to subscript an array, that subscript should have type `size_t`.

### Pointers and array

* When using an array as the target of a pointer, the compiler substitutes a pointer to the first elelemt.

``` c++
string *p2 = nums; // equivalent to p2 = &nums[0]
```

* When using an array as an initializer for a variable using `auto` (E.g. `auto ia(arr);`) the deduced type is a pointer , not an array.
In this case, `ia` points to the first element in `arr`. This implicit conversion does not happen when using `decltype`. E.g. `decltype(arr) ia = {0, 1, 2, 3}` creates an array of 4 `int`.

Pointers to array elements support the same operations as iterators on vectors and strings.

**Example of iterator methods applied to arrays**
``` c++
	int ia[] = {0, 1, 2, 3};
	int *pbeg = begin(ia);
	int *pend = end(ia);
	
	while (pbeg != pend && *pbeg >=0) {
		cout << *pbeg;
		pbeg++;
	}
```

It is possible to initialize a vector from an array. E.g.
```c++
int int_arr[] = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
// ivec has six elements; each is a copy of the corresponding element in int_arr
vector<int> ivec(begin(int_arr), end(int_arr));
```

**Advice: Use Library Types Instead of Arrays**

### Multidimensional Arrays ###

Multidimensional arrays are defined as:

```c++
int ia[2][3] = {
{1, 2, 3},
{4, 5, 6}};
// ia is an array of ints of 2 arrays of 3 elements each
```
Use of the for range loop with md arrays:

```c++
// print the value of each element in ia, with each inner array on its own line
// p points to an array of four ints
for (auto p = ia; p != ia + 3; ++p) {
// q points to the first element of an array of four ints; that is, q points to an int
for (auto q = p; q != p + 4; ++q)
cout << *q << ' ';
cout << endl;
}
```

**Care for the difference and handling of C-style stirngs!**
